The only sites where people can put together a complete computer
build are company-specific. That is, when a user puts together a
computer build on Dell, Alienware, or Digital Storm, the user is forced
to use that company’s cases, cooling solutions, and assembly
services, which all end up being very expensive compared to
buying similar parts from Newegg or Amazon and assembling them.</p>
<p class = "lead">
Newegg is great for seeing what products are available for a single
component (at a certain cost, from a certain manufacturer, etc.)
but there is no way to easily compose a list of parts that work
together and fit a budget using their website. That’s where
Computer Builder comes in handy, by allowing user to make their
own builds and post it on the site and have other users share their
thoughts about it.
